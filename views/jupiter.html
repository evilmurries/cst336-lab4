        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun. It is a gas giant, and the 
        largest planet in our solar system. It features a "giant red spot" which
        is a storm that has been raging for hundreds of years! Some scientists believe
        that Jupiter could be a failed star, and it has 79 moons!
